<h1>Project FADRA:</h1>

<h2>What is project FADRA?</h2></font>
<p>Project FADRA is shorted for Five A Day Run Away, it is a game made in the unity engine where you the player play as a fruit trying to escape the chef before you get eaten</p>

<h2>The Object of Project FADRA At The Moment</h2>
<p>Because at the moment the application is still in a prototype phase the current objective is to find eight hidden red orbs. This is because I wanted to show the main feature off which is the kitchen</p>

<h2>How can I follow the development of FADRA?</h2>
<p>Quite simply really, the link at the end will take you to a Trello page where you will be able to see what gets updated with the game and what is also to come: Click <a href="https://trello.com/b/SWUTArVE/fadra">Here</a></a></p>
